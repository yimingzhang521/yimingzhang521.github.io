 I am a tenure-track Professor at the School of [Mechanical Engineering, Zhejiang University](http://me.zju.edu.cn/meenglish/main.psp). I got PhD from the University of Florida in 2018 and a BS from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012. Before joining Zhejiang University in 2021, I was a Lead Engineer at GE Research Center, where I developed industrial AI algorithms for designing and managing large-scale aero-engine fleets. 

My research interests include decision-making algorithms under uncertainty, aero-engine risk management and the intersection of reliability engineering and artificial intelligence. I have led more than 10 major research projects, including Chinaâ€™s National Key R&D Program and NSF-funded project, and collaborated with civil aviation industries on reliability and maintenance optimization.
